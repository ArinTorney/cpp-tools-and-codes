## C++  
Pros:  
1. It is a very flexible programming language. It has a lot many features which can help create various modern and traditional control flows.  
2. It is very fast and compiled to native code. This is something which lets build kernel components, applications relying on real time data, games etc.  
3. It has a wide community. There are dozens of good libraries, even open source ones, out there for each particular job. There are many good compilers (e.g. GCC, Clang, MSVC etc.), linters (e.g. VSCode's Linter etc.), documentation tools(e.g. Doxygen, Sphinx etc.), build tools (e.g. CMake, MSBuild etc.) and other tools out there.  

Cons:  
1. It can be found as overly complex by a few, since it has a lot many syntaxes.
2. It is difficult to write error free code. Nevertheless, this thing enhances debugging skills by a huge extent. But debugging gets easier on practice.

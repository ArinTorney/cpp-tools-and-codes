# C++ Data Types  
## Introduction  
In a programming language, there are variables, which are bits of memory used to store data. Each of the variable is of a specific type, and is called a data type. These tell the compiler(interpreter in case of Python, Ruby etc.) how to read the data.  
## Variables  
A variable is reserved memory space for some value, and the type of it, and the memory address (pointer see Derived Data Types) of it defines how it is read. A variable has to be declared. A variable is to be be assigned to have values stored in it, with the assignment operator in C++ (more detail of operators later). It is up to the developer if the value is to be assigned while declaration, or declare and separately. Its value can be modified unless specified `const`. We process the values and display output using those values. A variable is accessed, declared and named using identifiers, or simply a variable name. The variable name has to meet the following criteria.  
1. It should only consist alphanumeric characters and/or underscore. Dollar signs are supported in GCC as an extension.  
2. It should only start with one of the alphabets or underscore.  
3. It should not be a reserved keyword in C++ like `int`, `goto`, `explicit`.  
4. It should not be the name of anything already defined before.  
## Data Types  
Now let us see data types. There are 3 types of data types in C++:  
### Primitive Data Types  
These data types are built-in and can be directly used to declare variables. These are used to make derived and abstract data types. This is the table of primitive data types in C++. (Note: The sizes many differ slightly, but they are very similar.)  
| Common Name | C++ Name | Size(bytes) | 
|-------------|----------|:-----------:|
| Signed Very Short Integer | signed char | 1 |  
| Signed Short Integer | short | 2 |  
| Signed Medium-length Integer | int or long | 4 |  
| Signed Long Integer | long long | 8 |  
| Unsigned Very Short Integer | unsigned char | 1 |  
| Unsigned Short Integer | unsigned short | 2 |  
| Unsigned Medium-length Integer | unsigned int or unsigned long | 4 |  
| Unsigned Long Integer | unsigned long long | 8 |  
| Size | size_t | Varies highly |  
| Decimal/Floating Point Single-precision | float | 4 |  
| Decimal/Floating Point Double-precision | double | 8 |  
| Decimal/Floating Point High-precision | long double | >=8 |  
| Character | char | 1 |  
| Wide Character | wchar_t | 2 (Windows)<br> 4 (Linux or MacOS) |  
| UTF-8 Character (C++20) | char8_t | 1 |  
| UTF-16 Character (C++11) | char16_t | 2 |  
| UTF-32 Character (C++11) | char32_t | 4 |  
| Boolean | bool | 1 |  
| Empty/Void | void | 0 |  

Note: Since C++11, there are fixed width integer types, namely `int8_t`, `int16_t`, `int32_t` and `int64_t` and fixed width unsigned integer types, namely `uin8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t` and `uint64_t`. These are only defined if the implementation supports the type of that width without padding, which most modern ones do.  

Note: Greater sizes of integer and floating point data types can store a greater range of values at the cost of greater memory usage.  

To variables of all these primitive and the upcoming derived and abstract data types, we declare them with the following.  
```c++
typename varname /*= value*/;
```  
### Abstract Data Types  
1. Class: A class is the building block of object oriented programming. It can be defined either using `class` or `struct`, but `class` is prefered for object oriented programming while `struct` is prefered for C style structs. (more to be talked of later)  
2. Union: A union is a single block of memory in which all the members share the same memory. It is defined using `union` keyword. (more to be talked of later)  
3. Enumeration: An enumeration is used to accept certain values as some specific predefined names. It can be declared using `enum`, which is more type unsafe, or `enum class`(C++11) or `enum struct`(C++11)(alias to `enum class`), which is very type safe. (more to be talked of later)  
4. Typedef: This method defines an alias to an existing type. A type and its typedef both refer to the same internal data type. There are 2 ways to do this.  
a. `typedef type alias;`  
b. `using alias = type;` (C++11)  
### Derived Data Types  
These data types are derived from primitive data types. They are:  
1. Functions: A function is a block of code which is defined to perform a specific task. It takes arguments as values and performs computations on it.  
2. References: A reference is a variable which refers to the same chunk of memory as the variable it is assigned with.  
3. Pointers: A pointer is a variable which stores memory address. Its size is 4 bytes on 32 bit systems and 8 bytes on 64 bit ones. It is used in memory management, arrays, C-style references and other dynamic data structures. Contents of pointer type to one data type  can easily be reinterpreted as some other data type, which is sometimes necessary for type genericity (accepting any kind of data as a void pointer helps avoiding multiple function declarations). They can also be reinterpreted as integer types `intptr_t` and `uintptr_t` but this conversion is usually regarded unsafe.  
5. Arrays: An array is a collection of items stored at continuous memory locations.  
All these will be talked of later.  
## What about strings?  
In C++ there is no separate type for strings. However, there are 2 ways of storing strings. The first one is `const char*` or `char*` or `char[]`, and their `wchar_t` and Unicode equivalents, which is the default type of string literals. The first two types here are basically pointers to characters, and the third one is basically an array of characters. All these go into derived data types. The other way is `std::basic_string<CharType>` which is basically a standard library class and goes into abstract data types.

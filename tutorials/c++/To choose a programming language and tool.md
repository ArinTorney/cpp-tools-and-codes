# To choose a programming language and tool  
## General purpose GUI applicatiions  
### Windows  
For Windows, C#, Visual Basic and C++/CLI are programming languages built for the purpose. However, since the original API is written for C, even C and C++ can be used. THe best option can be the native API for Windows, but MFC can also be used.  































































































































































































### MacOS  
For MacOS, Objective C and Swift are programming languages built for the purpose. Swift, however, has poor compatibility with C code. And Objective C is less memory safe. C++ can still be used, but it is really complicated.  
### Linux  
Linux has not made a separate programming language for its apps, but most developers prefer C or C++.  
### Cross platform  
Then maybe it depends upon the need. Usually C++ should be good, though. But there are many others too like Rust, Python etc.  
## Console applications  
These should possibly use C++, or Python. Curses library simplifies the job of making them.  
## Games  
For games, it is good to squeeze up all the performance. So C++ or Rust shall be good. But C++ may be better because it has a ton of libraries for it, and it has a properly designed object oriented paradigm. But somebody worrying about so called clean code may take Rust.

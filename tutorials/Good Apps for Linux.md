# Good Apps for Linux  

## 1. Gedit

On GNOME 3 and a few earlier versions of GNOME 4, the default text editor was Gedit. Even on Ubuntu until 22.04 LTS, it was Gedit. Newer versions of GNOME replace it with GNOME Text Editor, which seems to be worse than its predecessor. This app is excellent for general purpose code editing.  

## 2. Okular  
### Type: PDF Viewer  
### Package on GNOME Software: deb, snap, flatpak  
### Developer: KDE  
### User: KDE  
### License: GPLv2, GPLv3  
### Written in: C++  
This is possibly the best PDF viewer for Linux. It was created for KDE desktop environment, but it works well on GNOME. In fact, QT and GTK both look equally good on GNOME. This one is good because it supports features like PDF annotations, and many more, which are not available in Evince, GNOME's default document viewer. Adobe Reader released older versions for Linux and newer versions can still run on Wine. But even getting it set up is tiring, and even after set up it crashes.  

## 3. Pinta  
### Type: Raster Graphics Editor  
### Package on GNOME Software: deb, snap, flatpak  
### Developer: Cameron White, Robert Nordan, Olivier Dufour

This is almost a drop in replacement for Microsoft Paint on Linux and is good for general purpose drawing.

This is one of the many archivers available for Linux. It is majorly command line, but is used as a backend by many Linux archivers A few are given below. Except for the first one, which is dedicated to be a GUI for this, others also use other backends.

No better open source tool is there for the jobs it does. In fact even proprietary tools compete with Blender.

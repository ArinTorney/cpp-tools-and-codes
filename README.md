This is nothing, just a bunch of C++ and Rust codes and guides  to help programming.  
# Projects  
### C++
1. (about to come) Sho Shogi  
This is an application which uses SDL and Dear ImGui to create a playable board for Sho Shogi, which is the direct ancestor of modern Shogi, also called Japanese Chess. This uses SDL's software renderer backend. The ImGui part is a bit laggy (I don't think that is the reason though, because using OpenGL it is equally laggy.).

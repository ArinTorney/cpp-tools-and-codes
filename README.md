This is nothing, just a bunch of C++ and Rust codes and guides  to help programming.  
# Projects  
### C++
1. (about to come) Sho Shogi  
        This is an application which uses SDL and Dear ImGui to create a playable board for Sho Shogi, which is the direct ancestor of modern Shogi, also called Japanese Chess. This uses SDL's software renderer backend. The ImGui part is a bit laggy, possibly because of the same reason. It uses Noto Serif CJK JP Bold font licensed under SIL Open Font License 1.1 (https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-cjk/blob/main/Serif/LICENSE) and Ubuntu L font licensed under Ubuntu Font License 1.0 (https://ubuntu.com/legal/font-licence).

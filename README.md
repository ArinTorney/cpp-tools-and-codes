# cpp-and-rust-tools-and-codes
This is nothing, just a bunch of C++ and Rust codes and guides  to help programming.  
# Projects  
### C++
1. (about to come) Sho Shogi using SDL2 and Dear ImGui  
NOTE: The ImGui part is a bit laggy, possibly because I used SDL's software renderer instead of OpenGL renderer.
### Rust  
None  
### Tutorials and Blogs  
1. C++(./tutorials/cpp)  
2. OpenGL(./tutorials/opengl)(C++)
